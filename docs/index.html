    <p>Lumi Luna Co. is an encompassing brand for my artwork. The name Lumi Luna comes from the idea of a luminous moon. This is a brand I would like to expand on in the future. View my work on <a href="https://morgankissel15.wixsite.com/akissofmylife/lumi-luna">my website</a>.</p>
      
    <p>The Artwork I have made stems from my fascination with the moon and how its beauty influences our daily lives. I have been working in the mediums of watercolor and block printing. I plan to continue making work to add to this collecction.</p>
